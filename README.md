Lab #8: Read, Find & Remove strings


CST116
Module 8: Lab 8


Read strings
Write a program that includes a function to read (at least 100) strings into an array. 
Allow the user to either add a string or print out the contents of the array. 
Be sure to stop “printing” at the end of the entered values -- don’t “print” after the end of the user’s entered data. 
Also give the user the chance to leave the program. 
Be sure to break the functionality in this lab (all parts) into functions so that it adheres to a good modular design.

Remove strings
Add to your program from part 12b:
An option in a function that can remove a string from the array (and compress the array) based on its location in the array. 
Make sure that the “print” option reflects the removed string.
